      <title>A Hybrid Binary Classifier for Pattern Classification</title>

      <description>In this work, we propose a hybrid binary classifier which combines a decision tree with a support vector machine. The proposed hybrid model has the advantages of improved accuracy and easy interpretability. The model will be useful for feature selection cum classification tasks in real-world supervised learning problems. Numerical evidence is also provided using 25 standard data sets from various fields to assess the performance of the model. Performance of the proposed hybrid binary classifier is quite better when compared to individual classifiers.</description>

      <description>Emof_ai is a web API which takes a sample video as an input, detects all the faces in each frame of the video and performs classfication. It classifies the emotion of the face into 1 of 8 emotions viz anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral and none(this is when there are no faces detected in the frame at all and hence none means no emotion detected in the frame at all).</description>

      <description>Performed Exploratory Analysis on fraud detection dataset and tried to find interaction terms. Moreover, compared various classifiers offered by the scikit-learn library. Classifiers used are:
 Support Vector Classifier (with RBF Kernel) Support Vector Classifier (with Linear Kernel) Random Forests Bagging Classifier Logistic Regression KNN Classifier LDA Classifier GaussianNB Classifier DecisionTree Classifier GradientBoosting Classifier XGBoost Classifier Extra Trees Classifier  </description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;rdquo; attack.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
